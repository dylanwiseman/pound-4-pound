# Pound4Pound

Pound4Pound is a web app you can use to track your progress toward your fitness goals and calculate your pound-for-pound strength.

## Sign Up

Get started by completing the sign-up form. All fields are required, so if you don't know your personal records for bench, squat, or deadlift, you can guess for now, you'll be able to update them later.

## Home / Personal

Once you sign up, you'll be redirected to the your personal home page. On the left is a Strength Stats card, on the right is a Body Weight card that, for now, only contains intro text.

### Strength Stats

Near the top of the Strength Stats card, you can see your current weight, and a simple form to update your weight each day.

Below that form, you can see your personal records for bench press, squat, and deadlift, three common exercises. The "Goal" displayed next to your current PR is calculated according to your current weight and current PRs.
